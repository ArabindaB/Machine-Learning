# Machine-Learning
This repository contains machine learning projects I worked on.

The first file, "Activity_Classification.ipynb," contains the code for activity classification of tri-axial accelerometer data obtained by the Beiwe research platform. This project was part of the online course "Using Python for Research" on edX.org by Havard University. The instructor of this course is J.P. Onella, Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Director of the Health Data Science Program.

In this project, I use a Random Forest classifier to classify activities obtained from the tri-axial smartphone accelerometer. The training features are activity labels, timestamps, and accelerations along three cartesian coordinates: x,y, and z. Depending on the timestamp and accelerations, the activities are classified into four categories: standing, walking, stairs down, and stairs up, and are encoded as 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Our job is to use a machine-learning model to classify different activities as accurately as possible.
